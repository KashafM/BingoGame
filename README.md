# BingoGame
This game implements the use of 2D arrays and random numbers to simulate a bingo game. 
It substitutes a 0 to mark numbers that have been rolled. The rolled numbers are generated randomly. 
I have implemented a basic algorithm to check  diagonal, horizontal and vertical lines to see if 
there is a bingo or not.
